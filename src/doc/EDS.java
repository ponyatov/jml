/**
 * EDS: Executable Data Structure
 * <hr>
 * The EDS approach focuses on implementing a {@link homoiconic} object database 
 * which can not only store but also execute some subset of data 
 * as executable objects in a database context.
 * <p> 
 * This method let as represent knowledge in the form of high-level
 * <i>executable structures</i> via implementing <b>data interpreter</b>
 * or <b>model compiler</b>, and use these forms as a 
 * <i>generic computational model</i>.
